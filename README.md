# Google-Dino-AI
Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning for the Dino Game

## Introduction
Welcome to the Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning for the Dino Game project! In this repository, I have developed a hybrid approach that combines genetic algorithms with reinforcement learning to train an AI agent to master the popular Google Chrome Dino Game.

## Getting Started

## Processing
If you’d like to run the simulations yourself, you’ll need to install Processing. Processing is a flexible software and programming language tailored for creative coding and visual arts. It provides an intuitive platform for writing code and generating interactive visuals, making it an excellent choice for implementing the AI behind the Dino Game.

To begin, download Processing from its official website: https://processing.org/.

After installation, open the Dino Game project folder, launch the Processing environment, and click the "Run" button. This will start the program, allowing you to observe the AI agent as it learns and improves at the game.

## Why Processing?
You might wonder why I opted to build this project entirely from scratch using Processing, instead of using Python along with machine learning libraries like TensorFlow. My main goal was to gain a deep understanding of the AI model's principles and mechanics. By coding every part of the project myself, I delved into the finer details of the algorithms and explored the underlying mathematics behind them.

Sure, using Python and its advanced libraries would have made the implementation much quicker and more straightforward. However, developing the project from scratch has provided me with far more valuable insights and a much deeper comprehension of the concepts involved.
